### Middlewares are used in Node as if they were @decorators from python, eg: you want to check token before some decorator method we use middleware with the next() func to continue

### Docker init command:
`sudo dockerd` dockerd is the daemon service for docker containers, because it is not running in background we're not able to take any actions related to the service, which needs be restarted.

`docker exec -it <containername> bash`

### SQL QUICK CLI
